Everything is terrible. What do we do? America has gone into the shitter. We have a person doing Nazi salutes at presidential inauguration. We have elected officials who are doing everything in their power to hamstring democracy while punishing those that disagree with them. And on top of that, they have started going after anyone who is not white, assuming they are in the United States illegally. Watching all of this happen is horrible. But what can one person do against so much hate? I honestly don't know. I am doing my best to not let hate win inside of me. Wasting time hating the people that are doing this isn't fixing anything. They are bad people and no amount of me dwelling on the fact that they bad people will help. Instead, I am doing my best to find small ways that I can help my community get through this. I don't know what that means yet, but some ideas I had are help pay for lunches for kids that can't afford to eat, donate money to local charities to keep my donation in the community, take care of my mental health because I am no good to anyone if I am broken. Trying to stand up for what I believe is right. And I think that says it all. We need to do what we can in our communities and then start figuring out how to push it out nationwide. Take care of your neighbors, help those that need help, and please don't let hate win.
