"A guy spent five years traveling all around the world making adocumentary on Native dances. At the end of this time, he had every singlenative dance of every indigenous culture in the world on film -- or so hethought. He wound up in Australia, in Alice Springs, so he popped into apub for a well earned beer.He got talking to one of the local Aborigines and told him about hisproject. The Aborigine asked the guy what he thought of the Butcher Dance.""Butcher Dance?"" he said, confused. ""What's that?""""What? You didn't see the Butcher Dance?""""No, I've never heard of it.""""Mate, you're crazy,"" the Aborigine replied. ""How can you say you filmedevery native dance if you haven't seen the Butcher Dance?""""Umm. I got a Corroborree on film just the other week. Is that what youmean?""""No, no. The Butcher Dance is much more important than the Corroborree.""""Oh,"" the man said, his curiosity piqued. ""Well how can I see this ButcherDance then?""""Mate, the Butcher Dance is way out in the wilderness. It'll take you manydays of travel to go see it.""""Look, I've been everywhere from the forests of the Amazon, to deepestdarkest Africa, to the frozen wastes of the Arctic filming these dances.Nothing will prevent me from recording this one last dance.""""Ok, mate,"" the Aborigine replied, shrugging. ""You drive north along thehighway towards Darwin. After you drive 197 miles, you'll see a dirt trackveer off to left. Follow the dirt track for 126 miles till you see big hugedead gum tree -- the biggest tree you've ever seen. Here you gotta leave car,because it's much too rough for driving. You strike out due westinto the setting sun. Walk three days till you hit a creek. You follow thiscreek to the northwest. After two days you'll find where the creek flows out ofsome rocky mountains, but it's much too difficult to cross the mountains there,though. So you head south for half day until you see a pass through mountains.The pass is very difficult and very dangerous. It'll take you two, maybethree days to get through it. On the other side, head northwest for fourdays until you reach a big huge rock -- twenty feet high and shaped like a man'shead. From the rock, walk due west for two days, and then you'll find thevillage. You'll be able to see the Butcher Dance there.""So the guy grabbed his camera crew and equipment and headed out. After acouple of hours, he found the dirt track. The track was in a shocking state,and he was forced to crawl along at a snail's pace, and so he didn't reach thetree until dusk, where he was forced to set up camp for the night.He set out bright and early the following morning. His spirits were high,and he was excited about the prospect of capturing on film this mysteriousdance that he had never heard mention of before. True to the directions hehad been given, he reached the creek after three days and followed it foranother two, until he reached the rocky mountains.The merciless sun was starting to take its toll, and the spirits of bothhimself and his crew were starting to flag; but wearily they trudged on,finally finding the pass through the mountains. Nothing would prevent him fromcompleting his life's dream. The mountains proved to be every bit astreacherous as their guide had said, and at times they despaired of evergetting their bulky equipment through. But after three and a half days ofback breaking effort, they finally forced their way clear and continued theirlong trek.When they reached the huge rock, four days later, their water was running low,and their feet were covered with blisters, but they steeled themselves andheaded out on the last leg of their journey. Two days later they virtuallystaggered into the village. To their relief, the natives welcomed them andfed them and gave them fresh water, and they began to feel like new men. Oncehe recovered enough, the guy went before the village chief and told him thathe came to film their Butcher Dance.""Oh mate,"" he said. ""Very bad you come today. Butcher Dance last night. Youtoo late. You miss dance.""""Well, when do you hold the next dance?""""Not till next year.""""Well, I've come all this way. Couldn't you just hold an extra dancefor me tonight?""""No, no, no!"" the chief exclaimed. ""Butcher Dance very holy. Only hold once ayear. You want see Butcher Dance, you come back next year.""Understandably, the guy was devastated, but he had no other option but tohead back to civilization and back home.The following year, he headed back to Australia and, determined not to missout again, set out a week earlier than before. He was quite willing tospend a week in the village before the dance is performed in order to ensurehe was present to witness it.But right from the start, things went wrong. Heavy rains that yearturned the dirt track to mud, and the car got bogged down every few miles.Finally they had to abandon their vehicles and slog through the mud onfoot almost half the distance to the tree. They reached the creek and themountains without any further problems, but halfway through the mountain pass,they were struck by a fierce storm that raged for several days, during whichthey were forced to cling forlornly to the mountainside until itsubsided.Then, before they had traveled a mile out from the mountains, one of thecrew sprained his ankle badly, slowing down the rest of their journeygreatly. Eventually, having lost all sense of how long they had been traveling,they staggered into the village right at noon.""The Butcher Dance!"" the man gasped. ""Please don't tell me I'm too late tosee it!""The chief recognized him and said, ""No, white fella. Butcher Dance performedtonight. You come just in time.""Relieved beyond measure, the crew spent the rest of the afternoon settingup their equipment and preparing to capture the night's ritual on celluloid. Asdusk fell, the natives started to cover their bodies in white paint and adornthemselves in all manner of birds' feathers and animal skins. Once darknesshad settled fully over the land, the natives formed a circle around a hugeroaring fire. A deathly hush descended over performers and spectators alikeas a wizened old figure with elaborate swirling designs covering his entirebody entered the circle and began to chant.""What's he doing?"" the man whispered to the chief.""Hush,"" the chief whispered back. ""You first white man ever to see mostsacred of our rituals. Must remain silent. Holy man, he asks that the spiritsof the dream world watch as we demonstrate our devotion to them through ourdance, and, if they like our dancing, will they be so gracious as to watchover us and protect us for another year.""The chanting of the holy man reached a stunning crescendo before he removedhimself from the circle. The rhythmic pounding of drums boomedout across the land, and the natives began to sway to the stirring rhythm.The guy became caught up in the fervor of the moment himself. This wasit. He realized beyond all doubt that his wait had not been in vain. Hewas about to witness the ultimate performance of rhythm and movement everconceived by mankind.The chief strode to his position in the circle and, in a big boomingvoice, started to sing: ""You butch yer right arm in. You butch yer right armout. You butch yer right arm in, and you shake it all about...."""

""Did you see what your monkey did now?"" he asks.

""What now?"" responds the patron. ""Well, he stuck a peanut up his butt, then pulled it out and ate it"" says the bartender.

I looked around and didn't see anyone. Again, I heard, ""ribbit 9 iron."" I looked at the frog and decided to prove the frog wrong, put the club away, and grabbed a 9 iron.

Boom! I hit it 10 inches from the cup. I was shocked. I said to the frog, ""Wow that's amazing. You must be a lucky frog, eh? The frog replies, ""ribbit lucky frog."" so I decided to take the frog with him me the next hole. ""What do you think frog?"" I asked. ""ribbit 3 wood.""

I took out a 3 wood and, Boom! Hole in one. I was befuddled and didn't know what to say. by the end of the day, i golfed the best game of golf in my life and asked the frog, ""ok where to next?""

The frog replies, ""ribbit las vegas"".

We went to las vegas and said, ""Ok frog, now what?"" The frog says, ""ribbit roulette."" Upon approaching the roulette table, I asked, ""what do you think I should bet?"" The frog replies, ""ribbit $3000, black 6.""

Now, this is a million-to-one shot to win, but after the golf game I figured what the heck.

Boom! tons of cash comes sliding back across the table.

I took my winnings and bought the best room in the hotel. I sat the frog down and said, ""frog, I don't know how to repay you. you've won me all this money and I am forever grateful.""

The frog replies, ""ribbit kiss me."" I figured why not, since after all the frog did for me, he deserves it. with a kiss, the frog turns into a gorgeous and well-developped 15-year-old girl.

""And that, your honor, is how the girl ended up in my room. So help me God"""

And the king waspleased.Another country, significantly richer than the first, presented a peaceoffering of an ornate throne. The king accepted this gift graciously andwas most pleased.

"Jesus Christ is dying on the cross, his disciples are gathered around, crying. Peter looks up and notices that Jesus seems to be calling him, ""Peter, come hither!"" Immediately Peter rushes over to the cross, only to be hit severely over the head by the roman guard. He gets on his feet again and wants to return to the other disciples when he hears Jesus calling again, ""Peter, come hither!"" So, again Peter tries to climb the cross to get to his lord, when the roman soldier draws his sword and chops Peter's arm off. Peter is getting a little pissed and wants to go back to his buddies, but again Jesus summons. The roman guard can't believe that Peter is trying yet AGAIN to climb to the cross, and chops off another arm. Peter is now covered in blood and demented from the blow to the head and wants to call it a day. Jesus hoarsly croaks, ""Peter, please, come to me!"" By now, the roman gurad is tired of chopping limbs, so he lets Peter be. The faithful disciple struggles to climb the cross (without arms mind you) and after a long while he finally arrives at his Lord's side. Hurting, suffering, bleeding, Peter looks into his Master's eyes and asks, ""yes, my Lord. What is it?"" Jesus smiles lovingly and looks off into the distance as a weak smile plays across his face, ""Look Peter, I can see your house from here!"""
"Jesus has been crucifixed and reappears to his disciples. He tells them that he will grant them a wish before he ascends into heaven.

The disciples get together and confer. After much arguing Peter says ""Could you do that walking on water thing again? It was so cool"".

Jesus smiles, agrees and the next day they set out onto the sea of Gallilee in Peter's boat. They stop far from the shore and Jesus steps off the side of the boat onto the water.

He immediately disappears under the surface and the disciples rush to drag him back into the better. Jesus looks flustered, but vows to have a second go.

Once again he steps off the boat and sinks quickly below the surface. The disciples drag him back and apologize for having asked him to walk on water.

But Peter begins to doubt in the Messiah and can't help asking why Jesus can't repeat the miracle. ""Oh, I can"", Jesus insists, ""at least I could before I had these bloody holes in my feet""."

"Now while I enjoy the occasional nonsensical joke (Two ducks are sitting in a bathtub, one says, ""Pass the soap,"" so the other says, ""What do I look like, a typewriter?""), that's not why I find the ""difference between a duck"" joke so funny. Now a joke isn't funny if you have to explain it, but so many people have been expressing their incredulity at it that I feel compelled to defend it (and hopefully clear myself of the charges of witlessness). I always thought it was a very unique kind of joke I haven't heard any quite like it.
First, I think the question itself is funny. Why? Because it just fails to make sense at the last moment. Any way you attempt to parse it you get thrown for a loop. I guess it's a matter of taste whether you enjoy that or not.
The first answer continues in that vein with the same singular/plural confusion: It would make sense if it was ""One of its legs is the same as..."" or ""Both of its legs are the same."" Pieces of it make sense but not the whole put together I think it's something like a linguistic equivalent of the Penrose triangle. Actually, I think it is the equivalent, because that's exactly the same sense of amusement I get.
The second answer is the same, but additionally you can have fun trying to visualize the ludicrous image of a duck banging its head together when it walks.
The last one is just funny because it's absurd. I can't explain, just try to imagine acting it out to somebody.
By now, apart from thinking the joke is unfunny, you're also thinking what a loser this guy is trying to explain a bad joke and making a fool of himself in the process, so I'll just shut up now. But not before telling you the one about... ...the Buddhist who walks up to a hot dog vendor and says, ""Make me one with everything.""

Finally he gives in, fills up his gas tank and drives to Las Vegas.

The moment he arrives, he hears the voice again, only this time it says, ""Go to a casino."" Beginning to think that maybe the voice is leading him to something wonderful, he goes to the first casino he can find. As soon as he walks through the front doors of the casino, the voice is back, and says, ""Go to the roulette table."" So the guy makes his way to the roulette table as quickly as possible. By now the anticipation is getting him very excited. As he approaches the roulette table, the voice says, ""Bet everything you have on 24 black."" The guy pushes his way to the front, and throws all he has on the table and shouts, ""Let it all ride on 24 black!!"" The dealer spins the wheel, drops in the ball, and around it goes... Finally the wheel comes to a stop. The dealer calls out, ""14 Red."" The voice says, ""Shit!"""

He ignores it, and leaves the station after paying for the gas. As he's driving down the highway, the heat of the sun on his truck's black paint is enough to ignite his jacket sleeve. He drives faster, waving his arm out the window in an attempt to extinguish the flames, but they burn hotter! As he speeds down the highway, a state trooper sees the situation and pulls him over. He jerks the man out of the truck and rolls him on the ground until the fire is extinguished. As the man dusts himself and thanks his rescuer, he sees the officer is writing him a summons!

"One noted chef was a perfectionist. He made the most delectablemeals because he expected nothing less. Thus it came as a surpriseto one of his students that the chef used low grade spices. ""Why doyou use the worst spices when you expect the best?"" the studentasked him one day. ""Wouldn't your foods taste so much better if youused premium-grade spices?""""I once thought as you do,"" the chef answered. ""When I was learning,I bought all the best spices -- they were fresh and perfectly ground,no flaws whatsoever. But taken with their own perfection, they wereunruly spices, constantly fighting each other to be the dominant tasteinstead of working together. So I tried lower grade spices -- theyweren't so perfect, but they weren't so intractable either. And so itis well to remember, my dear pupil, that a glitch in thyme behaves fine."""
"Part 1:

One day a man with no arms showed up at a monastery, asking if there was any work. The monk thought for a while and asked if he could ring the bell in the tower by running into it with his head. The man with no arms thought he could manage that and started his new career.

For several days, the man happily rang the bell. Then one day he slipped, missed the bell, and fell off the tower, plunging to his death. The local constable showed up and asked the monk if he knew the man. The monk said ""No, but his face rings a bell.""

Part 2:

Same monastery, few months later. A second man with no arms shows up and says he heard the monastery had a job for a guy with no arms (and an opening). The monk explained and the man took the jobs. He also happily rang the bell for a few days before slipping and plunging to his death. The constable showed up and asked if the monk knew the man. The monk said ""No, but he's a dead ringer for the last guy."""

One of the regulars sitting at the pool table got up and came over to start up a conversation. He says, ""hey, I bet you 5 dollars I can lick my eye"". The new guy was a little put-off by this introduction, but it was early in the evening so he took the bet. Sure enough, the regular had a glass eye, popped it out, licked it, and put in place.

A funny enough parlor joke, he handed the man 5 dollars and went back to drinking. A few minutes later he returned, this time saying ""I bet you 5 dollars I can touch my elbow to the back of my head."" Desparate for any attention, the new guy handed over another 5 dollars and watched as the regular popped his shoulder out of joint and touched the back of his head.

Deciding he had already duped the new guy out of $10, the regular headed back over the pool table for the next few hours. As the bartender began to close up shop, he returned for one last wager. ""hey, I bet you $100 I can piss on the celing"". The new guy looked up at the vaulted ceiling which was eaily 30 feet above and was convince he would soon win his money back and a nights worth of drinking.

The regular pulled it out but didnt even come close, pissing on the bar and the local guy. ""Ha! I won all my money back! That was a stupid bet!""

The regular retorted, ""yeah, but I bet the guys over there $500 I could piss on you and make you laugh!"""
"The Pope met with his Cardinals to discuss a proposal from Benjamin Netanyahu, the leader of Israel.

""Your Holiness,"" said one of the Cardinals, ""Mr. Netanyahu wants to challenge you to a game of golf to show the friendship and ecumenical spirit shared by the Jewish and Catholic faiths.""

The Pope thought this was a good idea, but he had never held a golf club in his hand.

""Don't we have a Cardinal to represent me?"" he asked.

""None that plays very well,"" a Cardinal replied. ""But,"" he added, ""there is a man named Jack Nicklaus, an American golfer who is a devout Catholic. We can offer to make him a Cardinal, and then ask him to play Mr. Netanyahu as your personal representative. In addition to showing our spirit of cooperation, we'll also win the match.""

Everyone agreed it was a good idea. The call was made. Of course Nicklaus was honored and agreed to play.

The day after the match Nicklaus reported to the Vatican to inform the Pope of the result.

""I have some good news and some bad news, your Holiness,"" said the golfer.

""Tell me the good news first, Cardinal Nicklaus,"" said the Pope.

""Well, your Holiness, I don't like to brag, but even though I've played some pretty terrific rounds of golf in my life, this was the best I have ever played by far. I must've been inspired from above. My drives were long and true, my irons were accurate and purposeful, and my putting was perfect. With all due respect, my play was truly miraculous.""

"There was a chicken farmer who lived in a village in China. One year,his chickens were afflicted with a strange blight that caused them to lose their feathers. The farmer was deeply concerned about this, because winter was coming, and, if the chickens had no feathers, they would freeze to death. So, the farmer decided to consult the two wisest men in the land. First,he visited Mr. Hing, the renowned scholar. Mr. Hing leafed through all his agricultural and medicinal texts and pored over books and scrolls well into the night. Finally, he returned to the farmer and told him that, if he crushed the leaves of a gum tree into powder, made it into tea, and fed it to his chickens, they would be cured.The farmer then went to Mr. Ming, the great seer. Mr. Ming cast stones, read tea leaves, and poked through entrails until finally he came up with the answer: ""As surely as gum causes a shoe to stick to the ground,tea made from gum leaves will cause feathers to stick to chickens. ""Now the farmer was ecstatic. The two wisest men in the land had given him exactly the same prescription. So, as soon as he returned home, he took some gum leaves and made tea from them. He mixed this with the chicken feed and fed it to his chickens. But it didn't work.The chickens continued to lose their feathers, and, with the onset of winter, they all froze.The moral of this story: ""All of Hing's courses and all of Ming's ken couldn't get gum tea to feather a hen."""
"There was a little boy by the name of Billy. Billy was an ordinary littleboy who did ordinary little boy things, like playing, eating, bathing,destroying things, and going to school. One day, when Billy went down tothe bus stop to meet the bus to go to school, he found all of his friendshuddled around in a little group, talking about the Purple Wombat.Being a little boy, Billy was curious. So he asked them,""What's the Purple Wombat?""""You don't know what the Purple Wombat is?"" the children exclaimeddisgustedly. For the rest of the morning, they would not go near Billy,always standing far away and staring at him. Then the bus came. Billy,confused, got on the bus along with the rest of the children.""Hey, Mister Bus Driver!"" one of the chldren shouted. ""Billy doesn't knowwhat the Purple Wombat is!""The bus driver turned around abruptly. ""You don't know what the PurpleWombat is?"" he said in disbelief. He ordered Billy to sit in thevery back of the bus, all by himself.Eventually, they got to school, and Billy got off the bus and went toclass. Class proceeded normally; the students did the pledge of allegianceand worked on their multiplication tables for a while. Then theteacher led them into a unit on geography. Billy was not really payingattention, but he heard the teacher mention something about the PurpleWombat.Billy's hand shot up, and, when the teacher called on him, Billy asked,""Teacher, what's the Purple Wombat?""""You don't know what the Purple Wombat is?"" the teacher cried in alarm,""Get yourself to the principal's office right now, young man. No, no buts --march!""So Billy headed down the long, dark, frightening hallway to theprincipal's office. He slowly opened the large, heavy door, andtimidly entered the room behind it. There, at a large, imposing desk, satthe principal. The principal was a hulking man, balding, with a thinmustache. He spoke in a deep baritone voice. He was enough tofrighten little boys like Billy who had been sent to his office almost totears.""Well, Billy,"" he began slowly. ""What seems to be the problem?""""Mr. Principal, I just don't know what's going on today. Everyone's beenacting weird, and they're all treating me really badly. Like teacher justsent me to you and stuff.""""Now, Billy, I'm here to help you. I'm the princi-Pal, after all.Heh heh. Can you tell me why everyone's acting so strangely?""""It's because I don't know what some stupid Purple Wombat is.""""What? You don't know what the Purple Wombat is? That's it. I am callingyour mother, young man. Consider yourself suspended.""The principal threw Billy out of his office and told him to go home.Billy, crying, began the long walk home. When he got there, his mother wasstanding in the doorway waiting for him.""Billy!"" she called, sobbing, ""I was so worried about you! What happened?""""Mom,"" Billy cried, ""Everyone was being mean to me and I had to sit in theback of the bus all by myself and the teacher sent me to the principal'soffice and the principal suspended me, all because I don't know what thePurple Wombat is!""""What? You don't know what the Purple Wombat is?"" Billy's mother shrieked.""Go to your room this minute. Go! Just wait until your father gets home!""So Billy marched up the stairs and into his room. He collapsed on the bed,crying. After some amount of time, he heard a car pull in and some doorsshutting. His father was home. He could hear his parents talkingdownstairs but didn't know what they were saying. Then he heard footstepscoming up the stairs, and his door opened.""Billy,"" his father began in that lecturing-father tone, ""Your mother saysyou've been acting badly lately. Would you like to tell me what you've done?""""Dad, I haven't done anything! I just don't know what the Purple Wombat is!""""You...don't know what the Purple Wombat is. Well, in that case, you canjust stay in this room all night, mister. And forget about dinner!""Billy's father slammed the door and stormed off. Billy collapsed on hisbed, crying his eyes out. He spent the next several hours that way -- lyingthere, crying, wishing he would wake up.Then, in the middle of the night, he heard a voice. It said:""Billy. I am the Purple Wombat, Billy.""Billy sat up with a start. He looked around the room, trying to find thesource of the voice, but he could not.""Billy. I am the Purple Wombat. Find me, Billy.""It was coming from out the window. So Billy got up, put his shoes on,opened the window, and climbed out on to the roof.""Billy. I am the Purple Wombat.""Billy jumped down off the roof and followed the voice down the road. He gotto the edge of a wood.""Billy. I am the Purple Wombat. Follow me, Billy.""The voice was coming from inside the wood. It was very dark and veryfrightening, but Billy didn't care. He had to find out what the PurpleWombat was. So, bravely, he entered the wood.""Billy. I am the Purple Wombat. Keep going, Billy.""Billy kept going into the wood. He could hardly see anything, and he keptfalling down and walking into things and hurting himself. But he kept going,driven by a need to find this enigma that kept calling his name.""Billy. I am the Purple Wombat. This way, Billy.""Eventually, Billy emerged from the wood. He was on the shore of the townlake.""Billy. I am the Purple Wombat. I'm out here, Billy.""It was coming from out across the lake. Billy got one of the small rowboatsfrom the dock, untied it, and rowed out. Since he was only a small boy, itwas very difficult. But he had to find out what the Purple Wombat was.""Billy. I am the Purple Wombat. Row, Billy.""The voice was coming from across the lake. Billy doubled his effort, andthe boat began to move a little faster. When he was about half way acrossthe lake, he heard: ""Billy, I am the Purple Wombat. I'm up here, Billy.""It was coming from directly above him. Billy stopped rowing and stood upto look for it. The boat tipped over, dumping him in the lake. Billy didn'tknow how to swim, so he drowned.Moral: Don't stand up in a boat."

It sails off in a nice, long arc, but as it comes down the two men can see that it's heading straight for the water trap.

Just then, a wind picks up, and a lily pad is blown directly into the ball's path. The ball lands on the lily pad, and after a few seconds a frog hops up onto the pad, grabs the ball in its mouth, jumps off the pad and swims for shore.

When the frog reaches dry land, it spits out the ball, and no sooner has it disappeared into the water than a squirrel comes running up to the ball, grabs it in its paws, and scampers off across the grass. But before it can reach the trees, a hawk swoops down out of nowhere, grabs the squirrel in its talons, and begins to climb back up into the sky. Panicked and struggling to get free, the squirrel releases the ball from its paws, and with the altitude and speed gained from the hawk, the ball sails down in a long, clean fall straight into the hole. Hole in one.

The second man turns to the first, and says ""OK, God. Are you going to play golf or are you going to fuck around?"""

We really loved each other and we wanted everything to be perfect... and pretty much everything was, except that one thing had been bothering me. Her sister was a babe and many times I visited, she would flirt with me, bending over in front of me, things I didn't want to acknowledge.

Well a couple of nights before the wedding, she called me over to help her with some boxes. She was moving out of her apartment. When I arrived, I found her alone on the couch wearing decidedly little. I was shocked and she explained to me that she'd always wanted me and that it was her final opportunity, as these were my last few days as a bachelor. Well, I didn't know what to do. She told me she would go upstairs and wait and if I wanted to, I could follow her, but if I didn't, I could just leave.

I waited for a moment and then went outside only to find her dad almost in tears with joy saying he knew now that I was really the right man and that I had his blessing to marry his daughter. This was a test to see just how loyal I was!
